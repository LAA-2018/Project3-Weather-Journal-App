# Introduction
The project about a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. The tool can give pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.

# Step To Run The Project:

- npm install
- npm run build-prod to generate a dist folder for prod
- npm run start to run the Express server on port 8080
